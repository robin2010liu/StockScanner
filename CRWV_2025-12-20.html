Revenue comes from committed/contracted capacity and on‑demand usage. The company pivoted from crypto infrastructure and listed on Nasdaq in March 2025. HQ: Livingston, NJ. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Scale and footprint: Rapidly expanding data center capacity (active power ~590 MW at 9/30/25; contracted power ~2.9 GW). (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Competitive position: Positioned as a focused AI infrastructure provider with deep Nvidia alignment and software tooling (e.g., W&amp;B, OpenPipe). Competes with hyperscalers (AWS/Azure/GCP), Oracle OCI, and GPU clouds/hosters (APLD, CORZ, IREN, etc.). (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)</p>

- Revenue and earnings (GAAP):
  - Q1: $982M revenue; net loss $315M.
  - Q2: $1.213B revenue; net loss $291M.
  - Q3: $1.365B revenue; net loss $110M; interest expense $311M; operating income $52M (4% margin). YoY revenue growth Q3: +134%. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Profitability (non‑GAAP):
  - Adjusted EBITDA: Q1 $606M (62% margin); Q2 $753M (62%); Q3 $838M (61%). Adjusted operating income Q3: $217M (16% margin). (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Cash flow and balance sheet (9M FY2025):
  - Operating cash flow: +$1.50B; heavy capex: -$6.35B (property &amp; equipment); net FCF therefore deeply negative through scale‑up. Cash &amp; restricted cash (current and non‑current) together near $3.0B at 9/30/25. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Backlog/visibility:
  - Revenue backlog (RPO plus other committed amounts): $55.6B at 9/30/25; “no single customer &gt;~35% of backlog,” down from earlier levels. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Leverage and refinancing:
  - Issued $2.0B 9.25% senior notes due 2030 in Q2; $1.75B 9.00% senior notes due 2031 in Q3; also added DDTL facilities at SOFR +4% to +4.25%. Interest expense is currently a major headwind. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Guidance/trajectory:
  - FY2025 revenue outlook: $5.05–$5.15B; capex timing shifts into early 2026 due to a third‑party data center delay. (<a href="https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nasdaq/crwv/investor-relations/earnings-call/q3-2025?utm_source=openai">alphaspread.com</a>)</p>
<p>Valuation snapshot (as of Dec 19–20, 2025; rounded)
- Price: $83.00; Market cap ≈ $41B; Enterprise value ≈ $58B.
- Multiples: P/S (ttm) ~7.1x; P/B ~10.7x; EV/Revenue ~5.7–7x (source mixes); EV/EBITDA ~17–22x (note: adjusted EBITDA). (<a href="https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/crwv/statistics/?utm_source=openai">stockanalysis.com</a>)
Peer context (approximate EV/EBITDA):
- Oracle (ORCL) ~22.7x; Akamai (AKAM) ~14.7x; DigitalOcean (DOCN) ~15–21x; Applied Digital (APLD) negative on EBITDA/EBIT. CRWV trades at a premium to infra/cloud midcaps and in line with ORCL on EV/EBITDA—though CRWV’s metric is heavily “non‑GAAP EBITDA” while free cash flow is negative during build‑out. (<a href="https://valueinvesting.io/ORCL/valuation/ev_ebitda-multiples?utm_source=openai">valueinvesting.io</a>)</p>
<p>3) Business quality and moat
- Advantages:
  - Supply and ecosystem: Deep Nvidia alignment; first‑mover scale in Blackwell/GB300 NVL72 deployments; strong AI‑centric orchestration stack and developer tooling (W&amp;B, OpenPipe). (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
  - Demand visibility: Very large multi‑year commitments expand backlog (e.g., new/expanded deals with Meta and OpenAI in Q3). (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Key risks to quality:
  - Customer concentration historically high (Microsoft was 62% of 2024 revenue per S‑1 coverage) and is diluting but still material. (<a href="https://fortune.com/2025/03/03/coreweave-ipo-s1-filing-nasdaq-ai-cloud-nvidia-microsoft/?utm_source=openai">fortune.com</a>)
  - Capital intensity/financing costs and hardware obsolescence cycles; execution depends on continual access to GPUs and power. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
  - Competition from hyperscalers and specialized GPU providers; potential pricing pressure. (<a href="https://www.akamai.com/newsroom/press-release/akamai-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results?utm_source=openai">akamai.com</a>)</p>
<p>4) Management and leadership assessment
- CEO: Michael Intrator (co‑founder; previously ran Hudson Ridge Asset Management). CFO: Nitin Agrawal (ex‑Google Cloud finance VP; ex‑AWS Compute finance; ex‑Mapbox CFO). Several senior leaders from Google/AWS joined in 2024–2025. (<a href="https://www.coreweave.com/leadership/mike-intrator?utm_source=openai">coreweave.com</a>)
- Capital allocation &amp; execution:
  - Aggressive scaling via debt and OEM financing; multiple note issues, delayed draw term loans; strategic acquisitions (Weights &amp; Biases, OpenPipe). (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Controls/governance:
  - Q3 10‑Q notes material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting (ITGCs, segregation of duties, staffing). Monitoring remediation is important. (<a href="https://fintel.io/doc/sec-coreweave-inc-1769628-10q-2025-november-13-20405-1218?utm_source=openai">fintel.io</a>)
- Insider activity:
  - Some insider sales post‑lockup (e.g., CFO Form 4 in Sept; additional sales by directors highlighted in press coverage), contributing to volatility. (<a href="https://www.stocktitan.net/sec-filings/CRWV/form-4-core-weave-inc-insider-trading-activity-9df61d273692.html?utm_source=openai">stocktitan.net</a>)</p>
<p>5) Growth opportunities and catalysts
- Multi‑year, contracted AI demand: Backlog rose to $55.6B, with new/expanded agreements (Meta up to ~$14.2B; OpenAI up to ~$22.4B total commitments). (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Footprint expansion: Contracted power ~2.9 GW; continued buildout in the US and UK; announced intent to equip a new Pennsylvania campus with up to $6B. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Public sector ramp: Launch of CoreWeave Federal and participation in DOE’s Genesis Mission (Dec 18, 2025) could open new, durable workloads. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-to-Enter-the-U-S--Federal-Market/default.aspx?utm_source=openai">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Product/tech: Early, scaled access to Nvidia Blackwell portfolio; software to improve utilization/observability; W&amp;B integration and OpenPipe acquisition may deepen developer lock‑in. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)</p>
<p>6) Major downside risks
- Financing and interest‑rate risk: High coupon debt (9–9.25% notes) plus term loans; net interest expense is significant today. Refinancing risk persists if markets tighten. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Execution/construction risk: Third‑party data center delays shifted 2025 capex into 2026; any repeat would pressure growth and investor confidence. (<a href="https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nasdaq/crwv/investor-relations/earnings-call/q3-2025?utm_source=openai">alphaspread.com</a>)
- Concentration and competition: Historically concentrated revenue; intense competition from hyperscalers and others; potential for customer insourcing or custom chips. (<a href="https://fortune.com/2025/03/03/coreweave-ipo-s1-filing-nasdaq-ai-cloud-nvidia-microsoft/?utm_source=openai">fortune.com</a>)
- Free‑cash‑flow burn: 9M’25 OCF +$1.5B but capex -$6.35B; negative FCF until scale and timing of bookings/capex normalize. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Sentiment and “AI bubble” concerns: Stock volatility has been amplified by sector skepticism and short‑seller scrutiny. (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/coreweave-stock-market-ai-bubble-a3c8c321?utm_source=openai">wsj.com</a>)
- M&amp;A uncertainty resolved: The proposed $9B all‑stock acquisition of Core Scientific was rejected by CORZ shareholders on Oct 30; near‑term vertical integration upside from that deal is off the table. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/core-scientific-terminates-9-billion-merger-deal-with-coreweave-2025-10-30/?utm_source=openai">reuters.com</a>)</p>
<p>7) Fair value estimate
Note: DCF is highly sensitive given ramping capex, interest costs, and evolving FCF. We triangulate DCF with relative multiples.</p>
<ul>
<li>DCF (simplified, USD, base case):</li>
<li>2025E revenue ~$5.1B (company outlook midpoint). 2026–2030 revenue CAGR ~27–30%. FCF margin ramps from ~8% in 2027 to ~16% by 2030 (reflecting scale efficiencies but still capex‑heavy model). WACC 12%, terminal growth 3%.</li>
<li>Resulting enterprise value ≈ $24–30B; subtracting estimated net debt (~$16–17B implied by EV vs market cap snapshots) yields equity value ≈ $7–13B, or ~$14–26 per share. Bull case (faster ramp, 20%+ long‑run FCF margin): ~$25–40. Bear case (slower ramp, 10–12% FCF margin, similar WACC): &lt;$10–15. These scenarios imply the market is discounting a longer runway and/or higher steady‑state FCF than our base. (<a href="https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/crwv/statistics/?utm_source=openai">stockanalysis.com</a>)</li>
<li>Relative valuation:</li>
<li>CRWV trades around 7x+ sales and high‑teens to low‑20s EV/EBITDA (adj.)—a premium to cloud mid‑caps (AKAM/DOCN) and in line with ORCL’s EV/EBITDA, but CRWV’s EBITDA is before heavy depreciation and interest, and FCF is negative. On relative terms, our neutral zone would be 5–7x next‑12m sales until FCF inflects, arguing for a wide fair value band. (<a href="https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/crwv/statistics/?utm_source=openai">stockanalysis.com</a>)</li>
<li>Fair value range (12–18 months, blended): $20 (bear) / $35 (base) / $55 (bull). Skews will move materially when management demonstrates sustained positive FCF and de‑risked capex timing.</li>
</ul>
<p>8) Wall Street analyst opinions
- Consensus: Buy/Moderate Buy; avg 12‑mo target ~$127 (range ~$32–$200). Recent actions include Citi reinstating Buy (PT $135); Roth/FCM initiating Buys at $110/$100; several target trims post‑Q3 alongside continued Overweight/Outperform ratings. (<a href="https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/crwv/forecast/?utm_source=openai">stockanalysis.com</a>)</p>
<p>9) Major investors &amp; institutional sentiment
- Notable holders/accumulators in 2025 include Magnetar (legacy investor), Vanguard, BlackRock, Jane Street (13G), with institutional ownership rising through 2025 as the float increased post‑IPO. Insider selling after lockup contributed to volatility. (<a href="https://businessquant.com/stocks/crwv/institutional-ownership?utm_source=openai">businessquant.com</a>)</p>
<p>10) Recent research reports &amp; news (what changed lately)
- Q3 results (Nov 10): Revenue beat; backlog doubled to $55.6B; guidance kept 2025 rev ~$5.05–$5.15B; stock fell on capex shift and macro worries. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Debt/cap structure: $1.75B 9.0% 2031 notes in Q3; $2.0B 9.25% 2030 notes in Q2; later, a $2B private convertible plan (press). (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Core Scientific deal (July 7 announced) failed at shareholder vote Oct 30; agreement terminated. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-to-Acquire-Core-Scientific/default.aspx?utm_source=openai">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Public sector: Joined DOE’s Genesis Mission (Dec 18) and launched CoreWeave Federal (Oct 28). (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Joins-Department-of-Energys-Genesis-Mission-to-Advance-U-S--Research-and-Innovation/default.aspx?utm_source=openai">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Sentiment: Several articles drew parallels to AI build‑out risk; short interest/noise increased; analysts trimmed targets but largely kept positive ratings. (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/coreweave-stock-market-ai-bubble-a3c8c321?utm_source=openai">wsj.com</a>)</p>
<p>11) Final verdict / investment thesis
- Bull case
  - Massive demand tailwinds for AI compute; accelerating backlog with Tier‑1 customers; early access to Nvidia hardware; operating leverage as capacity ramps; federal workloads as a durable second leg. If growth executes and FCF inflects by 2026–2027, upside is significant versus normalized cash earnings. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Base case
  - Growth remains strong but lumpy; interest/capex continue to weigh on GAAP earnings/FCF through 2026; valuation compresses to 5–7x sales until consistent FCF. Execution on power/build schedules is the swing factor. (<a href="https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nasdaq/crwv/investor-relations/earnings-call/q3-2025?utm_source=openai">alphaspread.com</a>)
- Bear case
  - Cost of capital stays high; additional delays; customer concentration/competition compress margins; potential dilution from converts; sentiment sours on “AI infra” cohort. (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/coreweave-stock-market-ai-bubble-a3c8c321?utm_source=openai">wsj.com</a>)
- Who is it for: High‑risk growth investors who can underwrite multi‑year capacity ramps and tolerate volatility; not a fit for income or traditional value profiles near‑term.
- What to watch next 3–6 months
  - Bookings/backlog quality and diversification; capex timing and power delivery milestones; net interest expense trajectory/refinancings; signs of FCF inflection; federal pipeline wins; any new multi‑year hyperscaler or AI‑lab expansions. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx">investors.coreweave.com</a>)
- Confidence level: Moderate on growth trajectory; low‑to‑moderate on near‑term equity returns until FCF clarity improves.</p>

      <p>Below is a concise, up-to-date equity research brief on Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: RXRX) as of December 17, 2025.</p>
<p>1) Company Overview
- What it does: Recursion is a clinical‑stage “TechBio” company that industrializes drug discovery by combining high‑throughput biology/chemistry, massive proprietary datasets, and AI models inside the Recursion OS. It operates one of biopharma’s most powerful in‑house supercomputers (BioHive‑2). Revenue today is largely collaboration/milestone income; there are no approved drugs. (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2024/05/13/2880164/0/en/Recursion-Announces-Completion-of-NVIDIA-Powered-BioHive-2-the-Largest-Supercomputer-in-Pharmaceutical-Industry.html?utm_source=openai">globenewswire.com</a>)
- Key partnerships and revenue model: Multi‑program discovery alliances with Roche/Genentech (up to 40 programs), Sanofi, Bayer, and Merck KGaA drive upfronts/milestones/royalties; Recursion also earns map/milestone fees (e.g., phenomaps) and option payments. (<a href="https://ir.recursion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/recursion-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results-and/?utm_source=openai">ir.recursion.com</a>)
- Recent corporate action: Recursion completed an all‑stock acquisition of Exscientia (announced Aug 2024; closed Nov 20, 2024), expanding precision chemistry and automated synthesis; &gt;$100M cost synergies targeted. (<a href="https://investors.exscientia.ai/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Recursion-and-Exscientia-two-leaders-in-the-AI-drug-discovery-space-have-officially-combined-to-advance-the-industrialization-of-drug-discovery/default.aspx?utm_source=openai">investors.exscientia.ai</a>)
- Competitive position: A leading “full‑stack” AI drug discovery player (biology + chemistry + computation) with scaled wet lab capacity, large proprietary datasets, and Tier‑1 pharma partners. The company’s open‑sourced Boltz‑2 model with MIT strengthened small‑molecule structure/affinity prediction. (<a href="https://ir.recursion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mit-and-recursion-release-boltz-2-next-generation-ai-model/?utm_source=openai">ir.recursion.com</a>)</p>
<p>2) Recent Financial Performance (latest reported: Q3 FY2025)
- Snapshot (USD):
  - Revenues: $5.2M (Q3’25), down ~80% YoY (vs. $26.1M in Q3’24) as prior‑year included partial recognition of a $30M Roche milestone. QoQ down from $19.2M in Q2’25. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001601830/000160183025000166/rxrx-20250930.htm">sec.gov</a>)
  - Net loss/EPS: Net loss $162.3M; EPS −$0.36 (vs. −$0.34 in Q3’24). (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001601830/000160183025000166/rxrx-20250930.htm">sec.gov</a>)
  - R&amp;D and G&amp;A: R&amp;D $121.1M (+62% YoY) and G&amp;A $41.6M (+10% YoY), reflecting Exscientia combination and program spending. (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2025/11/05/3181232/0/en/Recursion-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Update.html">globenewswire.com</a>)
  - Cash/liquidity: Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $667M at 9/30/25; ~ $785M (unaudited) as of Oct 9, 2025 after raising ~$387.5M via ATM. Current liabilities $155M; expected cash runway through end‑2027. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001601830/000160183025000166/rxrx-20250930.htm">sec.gov</a>)
  - Debt: Notes payable and finance lease liabilities totaled $20.8M at 9/30/25 (low leverage). (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001601830/000160183025000166/rxrx-20250930.htm">sec.gov</a>)
  - Cash flow: Net cash used in operations −$325.7M for 9M’25 (higher YoY mainly due to Exscientia integration). TTM FCF remains materially negative. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001601830/000160183025000166/rxrx-20250930.htm">sec.gov</a>)
- Valuation (as of today’s close; metrics can vary with data source):
  - Price: $4.68; Market cap ≈ $2.12B. 
  - P/E, Forward P/E: N/A (unprofitable). P/S ~40x; P/B ~2.0x; EV/EBITDA negative. (<a href="https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/rxrx/statistics/?utm_source=openai">stockanalysis.com</a>)
  - Peer context (TTM P/S): SDGR ~5x; ABCL ~30x; RLAY very high due to minimal sales. RXRX trades richer than SDGR and comparable to high‑PS platform peers. (<a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SDGR/schrodinger/price-sales?utm_source=openai">macrotrends.net</a>)
- Financial stability indicators:
  - Solid liquidity (cash/short‑term coverage &gt;4x). Minimal debt lowers refinancing risk; operating cash burn remains the main financing driver. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001601830/000160183025000166/rxrx-20250930.htm">sec.gov</a>)</p>
<p>3) Business Quality and Moat
- Advantages:
  - Scale/data: Trillions of mapped biology–chemistry relationships, &gt;60 PB proprietary datasets, and millions of wet‑lab experiments weekly underpin training of foundation models. (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2025/11/05/3181232/0/en/Recursion-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Update.html?utm_source=openai">globenewswire.com</a>)
  - Compute: BioHive‑2 (63 DGX H100s) provides in‑house, NVIDIA‑accelerated training/inference capacity; believed largest wholly‑owned pharma supercomputer. (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2024/05/13/2880164/0/en/Recursion-Announces-Completion-of-NVIDIA-Powered-BioHive-2-the-Largest-Supercomputer-in-Pharmaceutical-Industry.html?utm_source=openai">globenewswire.com</a>)
  - Partnerships: Long‑dated, multi‑program alliances (Roche/Genentech; Sanofi; Bayer; Merck KGaA) validate platform and provide milestone/royalty optionality. (<a href="https://ir.recursion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/recursion-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results-and/?utm_source=openai">ir.recursion.com</a>)
  - Open science/Ai: Boltz‑2 (with MIT) meaningfully improves structure/affinity prediction vs. typical ML baselines; open‑sourced to drive adoption. (<a href="https://ir.recursion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mit-and-recursion-release-boltz-2-next-generation-ai-model/?utm_source=openai">ir.recursion.com</a>)
- Key constraints:
  - Customer concentration: Revenues rely on a handful of partners and milestone timing (e.g., Roche phenomap acceptances). (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2025/11/05/3181232/0/en/Recursion-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Update.html">globenewswire.com</a>)
  - Proof through pipeline: Several 2025 program terminations heightened concerns about translation from platform to durable clinical benefit. (<a href="https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/recursion-pipeline-cuts-first-quarter-earnings/747119/?utm_source=openai">biopharmadive.com</a>)
  - Supply/computation: Continued access to top‑tier GPUs and high‑quality clinical data partners (e.g., Tempus) is strategic. (<a href="https://www.recursion.com/partners?utm_source=openai">recursion.com</a>)
- Pricing power/margins (future): Orphan indications (e.g., FAP) could support premium pricing; ultimate margin durability hinges on clinical success and competitive profiles. (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/04/23/3066022/0/en/Recursion-to-Present-Preliminary-Clinical-Data-from-the-Ongoing-Phase-1b-2-trial-of-REC-4881-in-FAP-at-Digestive-Disease-Week-2025.html?utm_source=openai">globenewswire.com</a>)</p>
<p>4) Management and Leadership Assessment
- Leadership:
  - CEO transition announced Nov 5, 2025: Co‑founder Chris Gibson becomes Chairman effective Jan 1, 2026; Najat Khan, PhD (ex‑J&amp;J Chief Data Science Officer/Head of R&amp;D Strategy) becomes CEO &amp; President. Board chaired currently by Rob Hershberg, MD/PhD (to become Vice‑Chair/Lead Independent Director). (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/11/05/3181227/0/en/Recursion-Announces-CEO-Transition-Plan-to-Drive-Next-Phase-of-Growth.html?utm_source=openai">globenewswire.com</a>)
- Track record/capital allocation:
  - Strategic M&amp;A: Acquisition of Exscientia to build an end‑to‑end, chemistry‑enriched platform; targeted ≥$100M synergies. (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/11/20/2984282/0/en/Recursion-and-Exscientia-two-leaders-in-the-AI-drug-discovery-space-have-officially-combined-to-advance-the-industrialization-of-drug-discovery.html?utm_source=openai">globenewswire.com</a>)
  - Platform investments: Completion of BioHive‑2; continued NVIDIA collaboration and models (Boltz‑2). (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2024/05/13/2880164/0/en/Recursion-Announces-Completion-of-NVIDIA-Powered-BioHive-2-the-Largest-Supercomputer-in-Pharmaceutical-Industry.html?utm_source=openai">globenewswire.com</a>)
  - Insider activity: Multiple insider sales in 2025 (mostly under 10b5‑1 plans), including by the CEO; dual‑class structure gives founders &gt;10% voting power even with modest economic stake. (<a href="https://www.stocktitan.net/sec-filings/RXRX/form-4-recursion-pharmaceuticals-inc-insider-trading-activity-b0f3ed68c76c.html?utm_source=openai">stocktitan.net</a>)
- Governance: Dual‑class shares (Class B = 10 votes/share) concentrate voting power with founders/insiders; investors should assess alignment carefully. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1601830/000160183025000062/rxrx-20250428.htm?utm_source=openai">sec.gov</a>)</p>
<p>5) Growth Opportunities
- Internal pipeline (current focus areas after pruning):
  - REC‑4881 (allosteric MEK1/2) in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP): Preliminary Ph1b/2 TUPELO data show median 43% reduction in upper‑GI polyp burden at 12 weeks in Phase 2 cohort; updated data shared Dec 8, 2025. Program has FDA Fast Track + Orphan (US/EU). (<a href="https://natlawreview.com/press-releases/preliminary-phase-1b2-data-rec-4881-familial-adenomatous-polyposis-fap?utm_source=openai">natlawreview.com</a>)
  - Oncology: REC‑617 (CDK7) with monotherapy/combination expansion; REC‑7735 (PI3Kα H1047R) nominated as a development candidate; RBM39 degrader (REC‑1245) and MALT1 inhibitor (REC‑3565) in/approaching Phase 1 over 2026+. (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2025/11/05/3181232/0/en/Recursion-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Update.html">globenewswire.com</a>)
  - ENPP1 program (REC‑102/REV102) for hypophosphatasia: Recursion acquired full rights from Rallybio; IND‑enabling underway; Rallybio received $12.5M equity milestone as work advanced. Phase 1 targeted 2H26. (<a href="https://ir.recursion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/recursion-acquires-full-rights-rev102-potential-first-class-oral/?utm_source=openai">ir.recursion.com</a>)
- Partnered pipeline/milestones:
  - Additional Roche/Genentech neuroscience phenomap acceptances (microglia map in Oct 2025) triggered $30M; company has now earned &gt;$500M cumulative partner upfronts/milestones. Potential &gt;$100M additional milestones by end‑2026. (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2025/11/05/3181232/0/en/Recursion-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Update.html">globenewswire.com</a>)
- Platform/AI advances:
  - Boltz‑2 and related pipelines (e.g., Boltz‑ABFE) may compress design–make–test cycles and broaden tractable targets; these advances can catalyze new partnerships. (<a href="https://ir.recursion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mit-and-recursion-release-boltz-2-next-generation-ai-model/?utm_source=openai">ir.recursion.com</a>)
- TAM expansion:
  - FAP (~50k prevalent US+EU5) has no approved drug therapy; oncology targets are large markets if efficacy profiles materialize. (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/04/23/3066022/0/en/Recursion-to-Present-Preliminary-Clinical-Data-from-the-Ongoing-Phase-1b-2-trial-of-REC-4881-in-FAP-at-Digestive-Disease-Week-2025.html?utm_source=openai">globenewswire.com</a>)</p>
<p>6) Major Downside Risks
- Clinical risk: 2025 pipeline pruning (REC‑994/REC‑2282/REC‑3964) underscores attrition risk and raises questions on translational validity of phenomics‑derived targets. (<a href="https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/recursion-pipeline-cuts-first-quarter-earnings/747119/?utm_source=openai">biopharmadive.com</a>)
- Revenue concentration/timing: Collaboration revenue is lumpy and milestone‑dependent; slippage in partner decisions or phenomap acceptances can swing quarterly results. (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2025/11/05/3181232/0/en/Recursion-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Update.html">globenewswire.com</a>)
- Cash burn/financing: Despite runway to 2027, sustained −$300M+ annual operating cash outflows may necessitate further equity funding if milestones slip or R&amp;D scales. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001601830/000160183025000166/rxrx-20250930.htm">sec.gov</a>)
- Competitive pressure: Other AI drug discovery players (e.g., Schrödinger, Relay, AbCellera) compete for capital, talent, partners, and GPU capacity. (<a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SDGR/schrodinger/price-sales?utm_source=openai">macrotrends.net</a>)
- Governance: Dual‑class structure and ongoing insider selling could weigh on sentiment. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1601830/000160183025000062/rxrx-20250428.htm?utm_source=openai">sec.gov</a>)</p>
<p>7) Fair Value Estimate
This company is pre‑revenue (commercially) and unprofitable; a classic DCF on corporate cash flows is not very informative. We use a risk‑adjusted program NPV plus net cash, alongside relative multiples.</p>
<ul>
<li>DCF (risk‑adjusted, single‑asset anchor: REC‑4881 in FAP)</li>
<li>Assumptions (illustrative base case):<ul>
<li>Launch: FY2030; Price: $100–150k/yr; Peak patients on therapy: 6–10k (US+EU5); Peak revenue: ~$300–$700M by FY2034; Op margin at scale: 30–40%; PoS (current Phase 2): 15%. Discount rate 12%; terminal growth 0% (orphan erosion offset by lifecycle mgmt). (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/04/23/3066022/0/en/Recursion-to-Present-Preliminary-Clinical-Data-from-the-Ongoing-Phase-1b-2-trial-of-REC-4881-in-FAP-at-Digestive-Disease-Week-2025.html?utm_source=openai">globenewswire.com</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Risk‑adjusted NPV (to equity, after tax, discounted to FY2025): ≈ $0.6–$1.5B (broad range reflecting pricing/uptake/PoS). Add net cash ≈ $760M (Oct 9 cash − debt), less platform opex through 2029 probability‑weighted. On our mid‑case, equity value clusters around $2.2–$3.0B.</li>
<li>Per‑share (assuming ~520M diluted shares post‑ATM): ~$4.25–$5.75 base case; bear $2.50–$3.50 (REC‑4881 fails; value ≈ net cash + platform option), bull $8–$12 (REC‑4881 succeeds and oncology contributes + partner milestones accelerate). (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2025/11/05/3181232/0/en/Recursion-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Update.html">globenewswire.com</a>)</li>
<li>Relative valuation</li>
<li>RXRX P/S ~40x vs. SDGR ~5x and ABCL ~30x; premium reflects optionality and milestone pipeline but remains sensitive to clinical validation. (<a href="https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/rxrx/statistics/?utm_source=openai">stockanalysis.com</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>8) Wall Street Analyst Opinions (as of Dec 2025)
- Consensus: Hold to Buy; average 12‑month target ≈ $7.25 (range $5–$10). Recent changes include BofA cut to $8 (May 2025) and Morgan Stanley trim to $5 (Jun 2025). Needham reiterated Buy with $8 after FAP update. (<a href="https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/RXRX/forecast/?utm_source=openai">marketbeat.com</a>)</p>
<p>9) Major Investors &amp; Institutional Sentiment
- Top holders (Q3’25 13F): Vanguard (~39.8M), ARK (~33.6M), BlackRock (~31.7M), Baillie Gifford (~24.0M), plus SoftBank and Mubadala among notable holders. Institutional ownership ~60%+. (<a href="https://portfoliosavvy.com/investment/75629V104/2025/3?utm_source=openai">portfoliosavvy.com</a>)
- Insider ownership and trades: Founders/insiders hold super‑voting Class B; 2025 featured multiple planned sales (10b5‑1) by CEO and a director. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1601830/000160183025000062/rxrx-20250428.htm?utm_source=openai">sec.gov</a>)</p>

- Upcoming potential catalysts (from company timelines):
  - Additional TUPELO data and regulatory interactions (FAP) late‑2025/2026.
  - REC‑617 additional data (2H25 into 2026); early Phase 1 data for RBM39 and MALT1 in 2026; REC‑102 and REC‑7735 Phase 1 starts targeted 2H26. (<a href="https://ir.recursion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/recursion-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results-and/?utm_source=openai">ir.recursion.com</a>)</p>
<p>11) Final Verdict / Investment Thesis
- Bull case:
  - Proof‑of‑concept from FAP (REC‑4881) converts to pivotal path; oncology assets (CDK7/PI3Kα H1047R) show early clinical signals; partnerships deliver ≥$100M near‑term milestones plus new program options; BioHive‑2/ Boltz‑2 accelerate cadence and partner demand. Shares re‑rate toward $8–$12. (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2025/11/05/3181232/0/en/Recursion-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Update.html">globenewswire.com</a>)
- Base case:
  - Ongoing burn offset by milestones and ATM‑bolstered cash; FAP progresses but remains mid‑stage; oncology readouts mixed; stock trades around intrinsic option value and net cash—our base range ~$4.25–$5.75. (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2025/11/05/3181232/0/en/Recursion-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Update.html">globenewswire.com</a>)
- Bear case:
  - FAP efficacy not durable; oncology fails to show differentiation; partner milestones slow; further equity raises needed before 2027, pressuring shares toward $2.50–$3.50. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001601830/000160183025000166/rxrx-20250930.htm">sec.gov</a>)
- Suitability: High‑risk, binary‑event biotech exposure with meaningful AI/platform optionality—more appropriate for risk‑tolerant growth investors or those seeking selective AI‑in‑biopharma exposure.
- Confidence level: Medium—improving technological footing and partner validation, but clinical execution risk remains elevated after 2025 program terminations.
